            <p class="mt-2" style="font-size: 110%">S'wooft opened in March of 2015 when Sarah Homan (founder) ran into
              a dilemma. She lived in far northwest Chicago and despite being within city limits, had very few options
              for pet care for her then 8yr old collie mix, Allie. Long work and commuting hours made it necessary to
              find a reliable daily dog walker and she was shocked at the limited options in her area, so she made it
              her mission to establish a loving, reliable, and professional pet care service for far northwest Chicago
              and the surrounding area. Sarah left her full-time job in technology recruiting in October of 2015 to
              continue to grow the business. Her dogs Allie and little sister Melo (2yr old Pit Bull mix) now enjoy
              having a daily walking buddy and seeing a lot more of mom!</p>

                      care for all our fur clients. She is a licensed and practicing massage therapist, and originally
                      came to S'wooft when she needed to reduce her client load following a significant wrist injury.
                      She's a health and wellness nut and a true Jackie of all trades, adding value and improving the

                      both for handling skills and tech orientation. He was frustrated with the constant turnover of
                      ownership/management, so when they also transitioned to more of a tech than a service company, he
                      left to look for a more stable “home” in the dog walking world. He’s an all-season bicyclist and

                      website). Her freelance keeps her busy in the evenings/weekends, and she was looking for something
                      that would compliment that work, that would also allow her to get outside and spend time with
                      animals. Her references spoke both to her charismatic personality, approachability, and her love
                      for pets, so we've been glad to have her on the team!</p>

                      She worked for over 5 years at two of Chicago's largest and best known dog walking companies and
                      brought her vast experience and insight to Team S'wooft after moving to the far northwest side.
